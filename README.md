# Homework 4 - Temperature Converter

Build an application using HTML/CSS and JS that converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius AND from Celsius to Fahrenheit, based on user input. 

This assignment is open-ended. The HTML/CSS is up to you. The starter code is intentionally super minimal. 

### Step 1 - Fork this repository.

From the assignment homepage (https://github.com/fewd90nyc/fewd90week4), click the "Fork" link on the top right. This will create a copy of the assignment in YOUR github account.

### Step 2 - Clone your forked repository.

From the repository homepage (which will be http://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/fewd90week4), click on green "Clone or Download" button and "Open in Desktop". This should open your Github Desktop App and prompt you to save the fewd90week4 folder on your computer.

### Step 3 - Build!

When the user hits the Convert button, capture the value in the field, perform the necessary calculation, and output the converted value to the field.

Add whatever HTML or CSS you want. Change the required functionality, add some cool features. Add a background image. The sky (and your time) is the limit!

### Step 4 - Commit and Sync

Work on your website locally and view it in the browser by opening your index.html file. When your site looks good, Commit and Sync with the Github App.

### Step 5 - Pull Request

Send a Pull Request to submit your homework. From your fewd90week4 page on github.com (https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/fewd90week4), click on the "New Pull Request" button and follow the prompts. 

### Step 6 - Publish with [Gitbot](http://gitbot.co/)! (optional)

Want to post your fewd90week4 project on your github.io url? Log into gitbot and click the fewd90week4 repository button and VOILA! It will (perhaps after a few minutes) be viewable online at http://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/fewd90week4
